In this paper, we propose a span-based extract-then-classify framework for the open-domain targeted sentiment analysis task, which is shown as below:Reliable news classification using transfer learning

## Overview
This project shows how to use text CNN, biLSTM, finetune PhoBERT and bert4news for reliabel classification using ReINTEL's dataset.

The model scored 0.9452 on the public leaderboard

## Note
PhoBERT fine tuning base on this project: https://github.com/suicao/PhoBert-Sentiment-Classification

bert4news fine tuning base on this project: https://github.com/bino282/bert4news
