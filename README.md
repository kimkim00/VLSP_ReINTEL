In this paper, we use transfer learning models for Reliable news classification

## Overview
This project shows how to use text CNN, biLSTM, finetune PhoBERT and bert4news for reliabel classification using ReINTEL's dataset.

The model scored 0.9452 on the public leaderboard

## Note
PhoBERT fine tuning base on this project: https://github.com/suicao/PhoBert-Sentiment-Classification

bert4news fine tuning base on this project: https://github.com/bino282/bert4news
